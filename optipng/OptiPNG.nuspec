    -------------
    !! Fixed a regression in the reduction of palette-encoded grayscale
       images.  This regression was introduced in version 0.7.
       (Thanks to Adam Ciarcinski for the fix.)

    Version 0.7     29-feb-2012
    -----------
     * Upgraded libpng to version 1.4.9.
     * Upgraded zlib to version 1.2.6-optipng.
    !! Resolved a rarely-occurring out-of-bounds memory access error in
       Z_RLE, by upgrading zlib.  (Thanks to Christopher Wichura for the
       report, and thanks to Mark Adler for fixing zlib.)
     + Added the popularly-requested option -strip.
       The only suboption currently supported is "-strip all".
     + Added the option -clobber.
       (Thanks in part to Maciej Pilichowski for the contribution.)
     + Added the option -backup, as an alias of -keep.

     - Deprecated the option -log.
     * Changed the activity display output from STDOUT to STDERR.
     + Allowed the option -preserve to save high-resolution timestamps
       on Unix, if the POSIX-1.2008 API is available.  This feature was
       previously available on Windows only.
     ! Fixed a minor precision error in the display of file size percents.
     ! Fixed a memory leak that occurred when reading broken GIF images.
     ! Fixed various build issues.
       (Thanks to Sebastian Pipping and Ville Skytta for the fixes.)
