Vagrant - Development environments made easy. Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.

#### About
Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

Vagrant was started in January 2010 by [Mitchell Hashimoto](http://twitter.com/mitchellh). For almost three years, Vagrant was a side-project for Mitchell, a project that he worked on in his free hours after his full-time job. During this time, Vagrant grew to be trusted and used by a range of individuals to entire development teams in large companies.

In November 2012, [HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com/) was formed by Mitchell to back the development of Vagrant full-time. HashiCorp builds commercial additions and provides professional support and training for Vagrant.

Vagrant remains and always will be a liberally licensed open source project. Each release of Vagrant is the work of hundreds of individuals' contributions to the [open source project](http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant).
